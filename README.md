# Customer-Conversion-Prediction

#Introduction:
In the context of a new-age insurance company, the efficient allocation of marketing resources is crucial for reaching potential customers and maximizing conversion rates. Telephonic marketing campaigns have proven to be effective, but they come with significant costs. To optimize the campaign's success rate and minimize expenses, the company aims to predict which customers are most likely to subscribe to the insurance product. By identifying high-potential prospects in advance, the company can focus its telephonic outreach on the most promising leads.
